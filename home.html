            <p>In 1994 a certain Mr. Potter won the Triwizard Tournament and gave his winning of 1000 Galleons to the
                Weasley
                twins. Fred and George started their business while still attending Hogwarts. Talent met the possibility
                and
                the
                start-up was up and running in no time. 1995, the twins senior year presented itself with a big, pink
                problem:
                Ms Dolores Umbridge, DADA teacher and Headmistress. After a while the Weasley twins felt that they
                outgrowed
                their alma mater and the time to step out into real life was upon them. They made an unforgettable exit
                and
                set
                off to fulfill their dreams. For years they were the most successful young businessmen of wizarding
                Britain.

            <p>They continued to provide joy and happinness as darker times arised. In the summer of 1997, the Death
                Eaters
                seized control of the British Ministry of Magic. In the spring of 1998, it was discovered that the
                Weasleys had
                been helping the fugitive Harry Potter, and the family went into hiding. Although forced to close the
                shop in
                Diagon Alley, Fred and George continued to sell their products via mail order. On the 2nd of May 1998,
                Fred and
                George Weasley fought for the light. As we know, the Dark Lord perished, but the brighter the day, the
                darker
                the shadows. Fred Weasley died of an explosion when fighting alongside his brother Percy Weasley.</p>

                his
                twin. Two years after his youngest brother, Ronald (Ron) Weasley became an Auror, he left his job and
                joined
                George and they together turned the already successful emporium into an even more gigantic
                money-spinner.</p>

                – you
                know, these are not likely to explode anymore when casting a spell in a hundred foot range of it -, we
